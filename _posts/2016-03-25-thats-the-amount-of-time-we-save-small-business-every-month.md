That's the amount of time we save small business **every month **on average.  By using Automation and Integration, we are able take daunting administrative tasks away from you or your staff.

**What is Automation?**

Automation is a custom process that we develop to help you perform certain tasks faster, more efficient and error-free.  The process can be as simple or as complex as you want, depending on the need.  

For example:  Several of our clients draft a contract for every project they take.  A typical process is copying and pasting the language from a previous contract, inserting pertinent details like client names, addresses, pricing, timeline, etc.  Even with the convenience of copying and pasting, this process can take up to two hours every single time, including double, triple and quadruple checking to make sure that the contract is error-free and that no confidential information from the previous contract is copied to the new one.

With Automation, every time you want to generate a contract, all you have to do is click on a button and our system generates the contract with all the pertinent language and information.  The system also automatically generates a PDF, attaches it in an online document signing service, and sends it to the client.  Once the client signs the contract digitally, it automatically notifies you and attaches the signed contract to your file system.  All **error-free**.

This is only one of many processes we automate.  For the past 4 years, there's always at least 5 (50 at the most) processes we were able to automate for every small business that engaged with us.

**What is Integration?**

Integration is a system that allows us to connect two or more different services together.  Services include, but not limited to:  Gmail, Yahoo, Google Drive, MailChimp, Quickbooks Online, Jotform, Instagram, Evernote, Twitter, Drop Box, Amazon Web Services and **438** other online services.

Integration gives us a step-up on automation.  By integrating these systems, you can control your data and make it flow seamlessly through any of these services.  

For instance: A company manages a project using an excel spreadsheet.  Every time there is an update on the project, the spreadsheet is updated manually.  All communications are done via email and everything is typed up and sent manually.  Once the project is complete, invoice is written via PayPal and once the invoice is paid, the project entry on Quickbooks Online is updated.

We were able to streamline this process by integrating their spreadsheets, email, paypal, and quickbooks.  Once a status is updated on any project, it takes a simple click to automatically send an email to the corresponding parties with any pertinent information.  Once the project is complete, it takes a click of a "Project Complete" button and it initiates a process to automatically generate an invoice on Paypal, send it and once you get paid, the system also automatically updates your Quickbooks Online account with the necessary information.  All of this without having to type anything twice.
